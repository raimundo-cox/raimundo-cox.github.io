My primary research focuses on understanding Kant&#39;s philosophical project as a unified whole,
guided by his revolutionary idea of &quot;reforming&quot; rather than destroying metaphysics. Departing
from traditional interpretations that follow Mendelssohn&#39;s characterization of Kant as &quot;all-
crushing&quot; toward metaphysics, I emphasize Kant&#39;s constructive goal: reforming metaphysics to
preserve its essential insights while establishing it on secure foundations.

Central to this project is examining Kant&#39;s methodological innovations and determining what
content a genuinely scientific metaphysics can include. My most substantial work here is a
translation and commentary of Kant&#39;s Inaugural Dissertation (1770), completed as my MA
thesis. The translation addresses deficiencies in earlier Spanish versions, while the 50-page
commentary uses Kant&#39;s reform of metaphysical method as its unifying interpretive principle.

Current work includes papers on Kant&#39;s definition of metaphysics and his commitment to
analytic method in philosophy. I hope to publish the translation and commentary after some
further correction.
