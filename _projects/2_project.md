Understanding early modern philosophy—including Kant—requires careful attention to the late
scholastic context from which it emerged and against which it reacted. Many concepts and
doctrines in modern philosophy have clear medieval and scholastic origins, making this
historical investigation essential for philosophical accuracy.

My research concentrates on Francisco Suárez, the 16th-century Jesuit whose Metaphysical
Disputations served as a standard textbook throughout 17th-century Europe, influencing figures
like Descartes, Leibniz, and Wolff. I examine topics including the conception of metaphysics, the
concept of being, the analogy of being between God and creatures, and proofs for God&#39;s
existence.

This work began with my undergraduate thesis on Suárez: &quot;Ens sive causa: The Causal
Understanding of Being in Francisco Suárez&#39;s Disputationes Metaphysicae&quot; (134 pages). I have
since developed papers on Suárez&#39;s influence on early modern philosophers, with my most
complete work being a full draft on Suárez&#39;s notion of being. Additional projects include studies
of Suárez and Descartes, and English translations of Disputations XII and XXVII.
