This project investigates the place of moral philosophy within Kant&#39;s systematic philosophy,
examining the metaphysical foundations that inform his practical philosophy and his distinctive
methodological approach. Key areas include Kant&#39;s theory of moral conscience, his treatment of
happiness, and the integration of his philosophy of religion and history into his broader practical
framework.

Rather than being disconnected from my other projects, this research represents their ultimate
goal. I focus particularly on Kant&#39;s conception of &quot;practical metaphysics&quot;—his arguments for its
possibility and limits—and the role of traditional metaphysical ideas like God and the soul in his
moral philosophy. This approach reveals how Kant&#39;s reform of metaphysics serves his practical
philosophical aims.

Current work includes drafts on Kant&#39;s conception of happiness and his paradox of method in
practical philosophy, with additional papers in development.
