## Course Instructor Experience

#### Philosophy of Religion (PHIL 0470)
Spring 2026 \\
University of Pittsburgh

Religion shapes human experience in profound ways, influencing our social, political, and moral lives—whether we're believers or not. This course explores fundamental questions in philosophy of religion, focusing primarily on the complex relationship between religion and morality, alongside key issues like free will, the nature of faith, and God's existence. We'll think through these issues systematically, drawing mainly from the Christian tradition while addressing questions that transcend any single tradition. 

Through readings from Augustine, Aquinas, Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, we'll trace how great thinkers have grappled with these enduring questions. To enrich our understanding and reveal both universal concerns and distinctive insights, we'll also engage philosophers from Jewish, Islamic, and Chinese traditions—including Maimonides, Mendelssohn, Al-Farabi, Al-Ghazali, Zhuangzi, and Mencius. This comparative dimension allows us to see how different cultures have approached the same fundamental questions, deepening our appreciation for both the diversity and commonality of human religious thought.
