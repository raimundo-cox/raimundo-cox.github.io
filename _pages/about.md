I work in the history of philosophy, with an emphasis on the modern period and especially Immanuel Kant.

I study the philosophical origins of modern thought. In particular, I focus on how modern philosophy emerged from and transformed medieval scholastic traditions. I work on Kant’s philosophical methodology and how this drives his innovations in both theoretical and practical philosophy. My master’s thesis was on Kant’s novel conception of metaphysics in his 1770 Dissertatio. I am also interested in criticisms of Kant raised by his contemporaries and immediate successors, particularly Hegel.

In addition, I work extensively on Francisco Suárez, whom I interpret as a pivotal figure between medieval and modern philosophy. My work on Suárez aims to clarify the scholastic background of early modern metaphysics, especially within the rationalist tradition.

More broadly, I am interested in how modern philosophy reshaped central domains such as religion, politics, and history. I am always up for a chat on current events and their historical origins. I hold a BA and an MA in philosophy from the Universidad de Los Andes in my hometown of Santiago, Chile.
