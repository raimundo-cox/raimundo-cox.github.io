I work in the history of philosophy, with an emphasis on the modern period and especially Immanuel Kant.

I study the philosophical origins of modern thought. In particular, I focus on how modern philosophy emerged from and transformed medieval scholastic traditions. I work on Kant’s philosophical methodology and how this drives his innovations in both theoretical and practical philosophy. My master’s thesis was on Kant’s novel conception of metaphysics in his 1770 Dissertatio. I am also interested in criticisms of Kant raised by his contemporaries and immediate successors, particularly Hegel.

In addition, I work extensively on Francisco Suárez, whom I interpret as a pivotal figure between medieval and modern philosophy. My work on Suárez aims to clarify the scholastic background of early modern metaphysics, especially within the rationalist tradition.

More broadly, I am interested in how modern philosophy reshaped central domains such as religion, politics, and history. I am always up for a chat on current events and their historical origins. I hold a BA and an MA in philosophy from the Universidad de Los Andes in my hometown of Santiago, Chile.

<!-- I am Raimundo Rolando Cox, a Philosophy Graduate Student at the University of Pittsburgh. Before
joining Pitt, I obtained my BA and MA in Philosophy at Universidad de los Andes in Chile, my
home country.

My research centers on Kant&#39;s practical philosophy, with particular attention to its historical
context and methodological foundations. I examine Kant&#39;s intellectual development, his
revolutionary &quot;reform of metaphysics,&quot; and key concepts like moral conscience and happiness
within his ethical system. This focus on Kant serves a broader purpose: understanding how
theoretical and practical philosophy intersect, and exploring the possibility and limits of
philosophical moral discourse about particular actions as particular.

My approach is fundamentally historical, situating Kant within the precise philosophical context
of his time while addressing his writings systematically. This has led me to substantial research
in late scholasticism and early modern philosophy, particularly the work of Francisco Suárez
and his impact on subsequent thinkers. I trace philosophical developments both backward to
Kant&#39;s predecessors and forward to figures like Hegel, using this historical framework to
illuminate contemporary questions about how philosophical theory relates to lived moral
experience.

Drawing on classical ideals, I prioritize the unity of practical philosophy as a cohesive whole,
where its dimensions—including the historical and religious aspects of human action—remain
interconnected. Practical philosophy aims not only to comprehend human action but to improve
us as moral agents and help us in the pursuit of self-knowledge.

While my primary interest lies in practical philosophy broadly construed, I maintain active
engagement with metaphysical questions, particularly those arising from Kant&#39;s methodological
innovations and their implications for understanding the nature of moral philosophy itself. -->
